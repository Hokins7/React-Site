When these animals are put on conventional treatment plans, the outcome is in many cases not promising. The side effects of the medication further compromise their immune system. That leaves them vulnerable to pathogens they cannot fight. </p>

For 600 million people in some of the poorest places in the world, 100 million of these animals are the backbone of communities and their best means of making a living.
